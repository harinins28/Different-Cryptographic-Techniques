# Cryptography Project

This repository contains implementations of various classical cipher algorithms in Python. These ciphers form the foundation of modern cryptography and are excellent for educational purposes.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Atbash Cipher** - A substitution cipher where each letter is mapped to its reverse in the alphabet.
2. **Caesar Cipher** - One of the simplest substitution ciphers that shifts letters by a fixed number.
3. **Affine Cipher** - A combination of multiplicative and additive ciphers.
4. **Vigenère Cipher** - A method of encrypting alphabetic text using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
5. **Gronsfeld Cipher** - A variant of the Vigenère cipher that uses numbers instead of letters.
6. **Beaufort Cipher** - A reciprocal cipher similar to Vigenère but with a different encryption mechanism.
7. **Autokey Cipher** - A cipher that incorporates the plaintext into the key.
8. **Running Key Cipher** - Similar to Vigenère but uses a long piece of text as the key.
9. **Hill Cipher** - A polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.
10. **Rail Fence Cipher** - A transposition cipher that writes the message in a zig-zag pattern.
11. **Route Cipher** - A transposition cipher that follows a complex route to rearrange letters.
12. **Myszkowski Cipher** - A variant of the ADFGVX cipher that uses fractionation.
13. **N-gram Analysis** - Tools for analyzing letter frequencies in ciphertext.
